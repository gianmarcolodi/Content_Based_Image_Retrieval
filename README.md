In this work we compared the performance of three different feature extraction algorithms,
namely SIFT, BRIEF and ORB, using a Bag-of-Visual-Words (BoVW) approach to encode
images into feature vectors. We also used a pre-trained state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN), the VGG-16, as a feature extractor and compared the performance of the
resulting embeddings against that of the BoVW ones.
